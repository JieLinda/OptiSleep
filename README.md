# 💤 OptiSleep: AI-based Sleep Disorder Prediction and Lifestyle Optimization

**OptiSleep** is a Streamlit-based AI application that predicts potential sleep disorders using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**.  
It then applies a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize key lifestyle factors — such as sleep duration, daily activity, and blood pressure — to improve predicted sleep health outcomes.
